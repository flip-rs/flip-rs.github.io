_The UI Builder for the Flipper Zero_

**Flip** is an innovative UI builder designed for creating user interfaces specifically tailored for Flipper Zero applications. This tool simplifies the process of designing, exporting, and integrating UIs into your Flipper Zero projects using Rust.

## Features

- **Intuitive UI Builder**: Design your UI with an easy-to-use interface.
- **Export to JSON**: Directly export your designs as JSON files.
- **Rust Integration**: Seamlessly integrate your UI with Flipper Zero apps using our dedicated Rust crate.

## Getting Started

1. **Design Your UI**: Utilize our builder to craft your perfect user interface.
2. **Export as JSON**: Convert your design into a JSON format.
3. **Integrate with Rust**: Incorporate the UI into your Flipper Zero application with our Rust crate.

## Key Components

- **Variables**: Define external variables in Rust and reference them in your UI design.
- **Actions**: Assign actions to buttons, like switching views or triggering custom Rust functions.
- **UI Items**: Manage UI elements through views, including customization and positioning.

## Integration with Rust

To bring your UI to life in a Flipper Zero app:

1. Include our Rust crate in your project.
2. Load the JSON file to render the UI components.
3. Pass in your functions and variables for full functionality.

For examples look into the [Rust Crate Repository](https://github.com/flip-ui/flip-ui-rs)!
